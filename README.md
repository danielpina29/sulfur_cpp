# sulfur_cpp

> This repository is a result of a development project to better understand how a modern compiler works, 
and explore the in's and outÂ´s of the C++ programming language.
The desired result is to have developed a fully functional compiler of *Sulfur* programming language, created by me as a way to 
further develop my knowledge in various topics of programming and computer engineering.
